# assignment-five

For my week five assignment, i was required to make a suite of tests which passed. After copy and pasting the provided 'mockdata.js' and 'app.js', i worked through the tests using the terminal to ensure all 9 had passed.

reflection:
unlike the previous 4 assignments, i didnt feel in control of this assignment and completed by using the help of ai, some of the tests example the last three tests was a case of changing a suite/name or get user byid were easier to follow, but felt like i was just typing a whole bunch of words on a screen & without some real case uses im still unsure on the importance of this process.
